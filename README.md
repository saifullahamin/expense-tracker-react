# Expense Tracker with ReactJS

A react project done as assignment in learning ReactJS. The app has basic add/delete transactions option with a display of the transactions, current balance and the expenses/income summary. I used Context API, State & Reducer Hooks with deployment on Surge using Github Actions.
